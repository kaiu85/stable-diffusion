It reduces computation costs, your carbon footprint, and allows you to use state-of-the-art models without having to train one from scratch. ðŸ¤— Transformers provides access to thousands of pretrained models for a wide range of tasks. When you use a pretrained model, you train it on a dataset specific to your task. This is known as fine-tuning, an incredibly powerful training technique.
